GIS Polygon Package
===================

Implements a Polygon type, which contains a slice of Lat/Lng points and some
useful utilities to operate on that data.

Functionality implemented allows:

 + Calculating the area of a polygon
 + Calculating the centroid of a polygon
 + Determining whether a given point is contained within a polygon
